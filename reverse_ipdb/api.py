    Identical to :func:`set_trace` except the host default is the Docker
    host-gateway name ``host.docker.internal``, which routes to the host
    machine from inside a container.

    On Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) the name resolves automatically; on Linux
    start the container with ``--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway``
    (compose: ``extra_hosts``) so it maps to the host gateway.

    Args:
        host: Hostname or IP of the listener to dial out to. When ``None``
            (the default), it is resolved from the ``DEBUG_HOST`` environment

            only behavioural difference from :func:`set_trace`).

            resolved from the ``DEBUG_PORT`` environment variable, falling back
            to ``4444``.

    (There is no ``frame`` parameter: as a convenience preset this always stops
    at its own call site. If you need to control the frame — a wrapper, a signal
    handler, post-mortem — call :func:`set_trace` directly.)
