"""The reverse IPython debugger.

``ReverseIPdb`` is IPython's ``TerminalPdb`` driven over a pseudo-terminal (set
up by ``pty_bridge``) so prompt_toolkit engages — tab/dot-completion, history
and colour. ``DetachMixin`` redefines the quit/EOF commands so that leaving the
shell *detaches* and lets the program continue, rather than raising ``BdbQuit``
into the debugged code; it comes first in the bases so its methods win.
