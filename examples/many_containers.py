"""Fan-in example: several "containers" dial out to one listener.

This simulates code spread across containers — each worker is a separate
process that hits a breakpoint and dials OUT to the same listener. You run
ONE listener and walk them one at a time.

    uv run ripdb-serve --keep                     # terminal 1 (leave it running)
    uv run python examples/many_containers.py      # terminal 2

Watch terminal 1: the workers queue up ("queued: ... (N waiting)"), and you
drop into them one by one. At each `ipdb>` prompt, inspect `worker_id` and
`payload`, then type `detach` to advance to the next waiting worker.

With no listener running, every worker's breakpoint is a no-op and they all
just finish.
