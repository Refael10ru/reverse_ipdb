# Tab / dot completion

`ripdb.set_trace()` gives you **real completion** — `cfg.<TAB>` lists
attributes, `ord<TAB>` completes `order`, history and colour all work — the
full IPython debugger, over the reverse/dial-out connection.

## How it works (and what it needs)

Completion needs a real terminal: the keystrokes (your TAB) and the namespace
being completed (the live frame) have to meet somewhere a TTY exists. ripdb
arranges that by giving the **target** a pseudo-terminal:

- `set_trace()` runs IPython's `TerminalPdb` on a **pty** inside the target,
  so `prompt_toolkit` engages and computes completions there against the live
  frame.
- Two pump threads shuttle bytes between that pty and the socket.
- The **listener** puts *your* terminal in raw mode and passes bytes straight
  through, so TAB reaches the target and its vt100 rendering comes back.

Requirements:

- **Use a raw listener.** `ripdb-serve` does this automatically for IPython
  sessions. With a plain socket tool use `socat STDIO,raw,echo=0
  TCP-LISTEN:4444,reuseaddr` — **not** `nc` (line-buffered + local echo
  mangle completion).
- **POSIX target.** The pty uses `pty`/`termios`. On other platforms
  `set_trace()` falls back to line-based pdb (no completion) automatically.
- Prefer the stdlib pdb anyway? Call `ripdb.set_trace_pdb()`.

That's it — there's nothing to turn on.

## This works *across many containers*

Completion composes with the fan-in model: point every container at one
`ripdb-serve --keep`, and each paused container gives you a full
completion-enabled IPython shell as you walk the roster. You never connect
*to* the containers.

## Aside: madbg (a forward alternative)

[madbg](https://github.com/kmaork/madbg) also offers a full remote IPython
debugger with completion, via a pty. The difference is direction: madbg is
**forward** — the debugged process listens and you connect *in* to each one.
That's fine for a single reachable target (or one behind an SSH tunnel), but
for code spread across many containers you'd be chasing N endpoints — which is
exactly what ripdb's dial-out fan-in avoids. Use madbg for a single target you
can reach; use ripdb to debug *out* of many containers into one place.
